## Notes

- All 16 checklist items pass validation.
- Spec was written using reasonable defaults informed by the PRD for: rate limit values (3/24h), news count (5 items), headline length (10–15 words), and predefined persona option sets.
- No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers were needed — the PRD provided sufficient detail for all critical decisions.
- Ready for `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`.
